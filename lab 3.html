<h1>The Quran</h1>

  <p>The Qur’an , which  called in honor of the Noble Qur’an , is  book of God among Muslims . It is transmitted by frequency ,  and that it is worshiped by its recitation,  and that it is the last of the heavenly books after the books of Abraham and the Psalms  and the Torah and the Gospel . 

The Qur’an is the oldest Arabic book ,  and is widely considered the highest linguistic value, due to the eloquence, rhetoric and eloquence it combines .  The Qur’an has an impact and virtue in the unification and development of the Arabic language, its literature, its morphological and grammatical sciences, and the development, unification and fixation of the basic building blocks of the grammar of the Arabic language , as it is considered a reference and basis for all the contributions of the great linguists in the development of the Arabic language, led by Abu Al-Aswad Al-Du’ali , Al- Khalil bin Ahmed Al-Farahidi , his student Sibawayh and others. Whether with the ancients or the modern to the era of Diaspora literature in the modern era, starting from Ahmed Shawky to Rashid Salim Al-Khoury  And Gibran Khalil Gibran ,  and others who had a major role in trying to push the revival of the Arabic language and heritage in the modern era. 

The credit for the unification of the Arabic language goes back to the revelation of the Holy Qur’an, as it was not unified before this era, although it was rich and flexible, until the Qur’an was revealed and challenged the crowds with its statement,  and gave the Arabic language a torrent of good casting and sweetness of prostration, and of rhetoric and eloquence what He was incapable of speaking to the Arabs .  The Holy Qur’an completely unified the Arabic language and preserved it from fading and extinction,  as happened with many other Semitic languages , which became obsolete languages  and disappeared with time, or languages ​​that were weakened and degraded, and thus not The ability to keep pace with the changes and tensions known to civilization and the peoples of the ancient and modern world.

The Qur’an contains 114 surahs , which are classified into Meccan and Medinan according to the place and time of revelation .  Muslims believe that the Qur’an was revealed by God through the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of approximately 23 years, after the Prophet Muhammad reached the age of forty, until his death in 11 AH / 632 AD . Muslims also believe that the Qur’an was memorized accurately at the hands of the Companions , after the revelation descended on the Prophet Muhammad , so he memorized it and read it to his companions, and that its verses are decisive and detailed,  and that it addresses all generations in all centuries, and includes all occasions and encompasses all conditions. 

After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, the Qur'an was compiled into a single Qur'an by order of the first caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, according to a suggestion from the companion Umar ibn al-Khattab . After the death of the second caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab , that copy remained with the mother of the believers, Hafsa bint Umar , until the third caliph, Othman ibn Affan , saw the differences of the Muslims in the readings due to their different dialects, so he asked Hafsa to allow him to use the Qur’an in her possession that was written in the Quraish dialect to be the standard dialect. And Othman ordered the copying of several copies of the Qur’an to unify the reading, and the execution of what contradicts that Qur’an, and the distribution of those copies to the regions, and he kept a copy of it for himself. These copies are known until now as the Ottoman Qur'an . Therefore, most scholars confirm that the current versions of the Qur’an contain the same text copied from the original version compiled by Abu Bakr. 

Muslims believe that the Qur’an is the miracle of the Prophet Muhammad to the worlds, and that its verses challenge the worlds by bringing a similar one or a surah like it,  as they consider it evidence of his prophethood,  and the culmination of a series of heavenly messages that began, according to Muslim belief, with the books of Adam passing through the books of Abraham , the Torah of Moses , and the Psalms of David , all the way to the Gospel of Jesus
